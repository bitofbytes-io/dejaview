# Reject a staged diff unless every entry is a regular-file add or
# modification of go.mod or go.sum.
#
# Generated *_templ.go files are gitignored and must not be committed.
# Deletions are rejected too: this job only refreshes module checksums.
#
# git apply --numstat is not enough: a rename is reported only under its
# destination, and a symlink keeps the same path. Inspect the index after
# apply, with rename detection off, and reject non-regular modes. Do not
# unquote paths. A quoted name, or one containing a newline, tab, or
# backslash, is rejected even when the text inside looks like go.mod.
